    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>I think that inside of me he black box are tubes that connect to a bucket, and when the bucket gets filled to its limit it will pour some water out.</p>
    <h1>Evidence </h1>
    <p>The most important data was when we poured the water in the box, either less, or the same amount or more water that we poured in would come out the tube and into the bucket. And </p>

    <h1>Reasoning</h1>
    <h3>Part 2</h3>
    <p>My evidence supports my claim because we got different data almost every time we tested the box. This proves that it is possible for more less or the same amount of water to come out.</p>
    <h1>Reasoning<h1>
    <h3>Part 3</h3>
    <p>If there was not a bucket like I described, but instead just a straight tube connecting the top funnel to the output, we would have observed very different results.  Specifically, we would have _____.  Because we didnâ€™t observe ____, we can conclude ______.</p>
